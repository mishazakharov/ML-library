# Machine Learning Library



<h1>What is that?</h1>

This is my attempt to create my own machine learning library written in Python. Now it is in the earliest stage, much of what is planned has not yet been realized.

*I am just tryin to learn here!*


<h2>Objective of the "project"</h2>

The main idea is to manually implement the algorithms of classical machine learning, i.e. supervised learning and unsupervised learning , in the hope that it will lead me to a deeper understanding of the concepts of machine learning.

Created strictly for **educational purposes**. In my study, I use the Internet as the main source of information for manual applications of algorithms (concepts, mathematics, and programming representation).

**P.S.** I am a newcomer. **Any help and advice is APPRECIATED!** 

*I repeat that I use this idea exclusively to learn, I do not follow commercial goals!*
