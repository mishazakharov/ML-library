# Machine Learning Library


<h1>What is that?</h1>
This is my machine learning library. 


<h2>Objective of the "project"</h2>

The main idea is to manually implement the algorithms of classical machine learning, i.e. supervised learning and unsupervised learning , in the hope that it will lead me to a deeper understanding of the concepts of machine learning.

Created strictly for **educational purposes**. In my study, I use the Internet as the main source of information for manual applications of algorithms (concepts, mathematics, and programming representation).

*I repeat that I use this idea exclusively to learn, I do not follow commercial goals!*
